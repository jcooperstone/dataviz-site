# Introduction

I've put together a short pre-test for you to take that covers the type of basic R stuff I would expect you to know coming into this course. If you are unable to complete this test, or really struggle with it, you should take the following free course https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-r-basics (audit only) before the 3rd week of class.


## Download R, RStudio, and open them on your computer

Go [here](https://biodash.github.io/codeclub-setup/) to learn how to get R and RStudio installed on your computer if you don't already have them. I will also have an [Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC)](https://ondemand.osc.edu/pun/sys/dashboard) classroom for this course so you can elect to work there through your web browser. If you want to do this, you have to tell Jess so she can add you to the account.


## What are the four quadrants in R Studio?
What happens in each of the quadrants?

## Install and load the tidyverse
When do you install a package and when do you load it?
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install, happens only once
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

```{r}
# load package, happens each time you open RStudio
library(tidyverse)
```

## 
```{r}
storms
```
