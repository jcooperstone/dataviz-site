Thanks to the authors and contributors of [Distill for R Markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) for making this web-friendly format for course websites, and to Yury Zablotski who's [blog post on creating a website in R with {Distill}](https://yuzar-blog.netlify.app/posts/2020-12-26-how-to-create-a-blog-or-a-website-in-r-with-distill-package/) helped me make this website.
