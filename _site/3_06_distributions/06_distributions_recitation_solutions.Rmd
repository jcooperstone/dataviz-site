## Introduction
Today you will be investigating some [data](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-07-07/readme.md) from the Coffee Quality Database on coffee evaluation by the Coffee Quality Institute. You will look at the distribution of coffee evaluation scores across different characteristics, and include various metadata.

More information can be found on the Tidy Tuesday github repo on [coffee ratings](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-07-07/readme.md).

### Read in data
```{r load data}
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2020-07-07')
coffee_ratings <- tuesdata$coffee_ratings
```

### Load libraries
```{r libraries, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggridges)
library(ggdist)
```

## Total cupping score in arabica and robusta
Make 3 different visualizations that shows the distribution of total cupping score across arabica and robusta beans. Make the plots so you think they look good.

```{r histogram}
coffee_ratings %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = total_cup_points, fill = species)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 200, position = "stack") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(total_cup_points)), color = "black") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(55,100)) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = "Total cupping score (out of 100)",
       y = "",
       fill = "Species",
       title = "Distribution of cupping scores across 14,000 coffee samples",
       caption = "Vertical line represents the median total cupping score across all samples")
```


```{r}
# dot plot
coffee_ratings %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = total_cup_points, color = species)) +
  geom_dots() +
  theme_ggdist() +
  xlim(50,100) +
  theme(legend.position = c(.18, .99),
        legend.justification = c("right", "top"),
        legend.box.just = "right",
        legend.box.background = element_rect(size=0.5),
        legend.box.margin = margin(5, 5, 5, 5)) +
  labs(x = "Total cupping score (out of 100)",
       y = "",
       color = "Species")
```

```{r}
# ridgeline plot
coffee_ratings %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = total_cup_points, y = species, fill = species)) +
  stat_density_ridges(quantile_lines = TRUE,
                      quantiles = 2,
                      alpha = 0.5) +
  xlim(55, 100) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#7B3F00", "#5C4033")) +
  theme_ggdist() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(x = "Total cupping score (out of 100)",
       y = "")
```

```{r}
# ridgeline plot
coffee_ratings %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = total_cup_points, fill = species)) +
  geom_density() +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(species)) +
  xlim(50, 100) +
  theme_ggdist() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(x = "Total cupping score (out of 100)",
       y = "Density of samples")
```

## Individual characteristic cupping scores in arabica and robusta
Make 3 different visualizations that show the distribution of all the individual contributors to total cupping score across arabica and robusta in one plot.
```{r}
# go from wide (each coffee attribute in a separate column)
# to long data (1 column w/ all characteristics, 1 column w/ all ratings)
coffee_ratings_tidy <- coffee_ratings %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = aroma:cupper_points,
               names_to = "characteristic",
               values_to = "rating")
```

Prepare to clean up facet strip text using the function `labeller()`.
```{r}
# getting labels ready for plotting
# what are the coffee characteristics again?
(coffee_characteristics <- unique(coffee_ratings_tidy$characteristic) %>%
  sort()) # sort alphabetically, arrange won't work here bc not numeric

# create a vector of the coffee characteristic names as i want them to appear on the plot
coffee_labels <- c("Acidity",
                   "Aftertaste",
                   "Aroma",
                   "Balance",
                   "Body",
                   "Clean Cup",
                   "Cupper Points",
                   "Flavor",
                   "Sweetness",
                   "Uniformity")

# tell coffee_labels which original label to refer to
# these need to be in the same order (which is why i used sort())
names(coffee_labels) <- coffee_characteristics
```

A violin plot
```{r violin plot, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# get fonts not default available in R
library(sysfonts) # aux packagew here fonts live
library(showtext) # package that helps use non-standard fonts
library(ragg)

# add the font Atkison Hyperlegible
font_add_google("Atkinson Hyperlegible")

# what fonts do i have to choose from?
# remove head() to see them all
head(font_info_google())

# use to indicate that showtext is needed 
showtext_auto()

# violin plot
coffee_ratings_tidy %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = species, y = rating, color = species)) +
  geom_violin(draw_quantiles = 0.5) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(5,10)) +
  facet_wrap(vars(characteristic),
             labeller = labeller(characteristic = coffee_labels), # all that work we did earlier
             nrow = 2) + # 2 rows in the faceted plot
  theme_classic() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        text = element_text(family = "Atkinson Hyperlegible")) + # changing font
  labs(x = "Coffee Species",
       y = "Cupper rating (out of 10)",
       title = "Distribution of cupper scores for individual coffee attributes",
       caption = "Line represented median rating")
```

```{r dot plot}
coffee_ratings_tidy %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = rating, y = species, color = species)) +
  geom_dots() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(6,10)) +
  facet_wrap(vars(characteristic),
             labeller = labeller(characteristic = coffee_labels),
             nrow = 2) +
  theme_classic() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        text = element_text(family = "Atkinson Hyperlegible")) + # changing font
  labs(x = "Cupper rating (out of 10)",
       y = "Coffee Species",
       title = "Distribution of cupper scores for individual coffee attributes")
```

```{r}
coffee_ratings_tidy %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = rating, y = species, fill = species)) +
  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.5,
                      quantile_lines = TRUE,
                      quantiles = 2) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(6,10)) +
  facet_wrap(vars(characteristic),
             labeller = labeller(characteristic = coffee_labels),
             nrow = 2) +
  theme_classic() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(x = "Cupper rating (out of 10)",
       y = "Coffee Species",
       title = "Distribution of cupper scores for individual coffee attributes")
