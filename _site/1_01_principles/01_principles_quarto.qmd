### Office hours: [go.osu.edu/dataviz-times](https://go.osu.edu/dataviz-times)

## Website {.center_title}

If you have found these slides, you've made it to the website! (Good job.)\
\

### **All course materials will be posted to, or linked to from [datavisualizing.netlify.app](https://datavisualizing.netlify.app/)**

\

## Syllabus

-   A full version of the syllabus can be found on Carmen

-   A trimmed version of the syllabus can be found on our [course site](https://datavisualizing.netlify.app/syllabus.html)

## Attendance {.center_title .smaller}

-   <p>Class will taught in a hybrid, synchronous manner, meaning I expect you to attend class during class time. This attendance can happen in person, or virtually via [Zoom](https://go.osu.edu/dataviz-zoom) I have found that students who attend in person are more engaged, and tend to master material more quickly. But, it is up to you how you want to attend.</p>

    \

-   I will record class time for those who want to 1) revisit material or 2) can't attend for some reason. These recordings are not to replace coming to class.\
    \

-   <h4>📌 please engage during class as much as you can</h4>

## How class will be?

-   A combination of lecture, code run-throughs, live coding, and hands-on exercises.

-   Bring a laptop (not tablet) to class with R and RStudio downloaded

-   Come with your questions!

## Previous programming experience

## Assigments {.center_title .smaller}

-   **Module assignments:** After each module, there will be an assignment to provide practice for the techniques learned in class. There will be 4 of these.

-   **Class reflections:** After each week, you will write a 1 paragraph reflection on the material that was presented in class. This can include your thoughts on how you will use these lessons in your own research and data visualizations, ways in which you have investigated this topic (or expect to) on your own, or what else you'd like to learn in this area. The purpose of this assignment is not to be burdensome, but to keep you engaged in the course material, and providing feedback to me on what parts you've found useful, what you've struggled with, and what you'd like to see more of in the future. There will be 10 of these.

-   **Capstone assignment:** At the end of the semester, you will complete a capstone assignment where you create a series of visualizations based on your research data, data coming from your lab, or other data that is publicly available. I expect this assignment to be completed in R Markdown, annotated, and knitted into an easy-to-read .html file. I also expect your code to be fully commented such that I can understand what you are doing with each step, and why.

## Late assignments {.smaller}

-   I expect you will turn assignments in on time. However, I am also reasonable want to see you master the material in this class. If there are extenuating circumstances that prevent you from turning in an assignment on time, please connect with me as soon as possible after such a situation arises for further discussion.

-   Unexcused late assignments will be docked 10% of total possible points per day late, including weekends. For example, if as assignment is worth 10 points, and it is turned in 1 day late without prior discussion with the instructor, the maximum score that can be earned with be 9 points.

-   📌 please turn assignments in on time

# Academic integrity 🏫 {.center_title}

-   It is fine for you to work with your classmates/labmates/whoever, but I expect you to turn in your own independent assignments representing your work

-   All assignments are open book, googling/investigating is required!

## 🗓 Schedule

This is our tentative class schedule - but subject to change depending on our pacing, and your interests!

## 🗓️ Schedule (part 1)

```{r schedule1, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(readxl)
library(knitr)
schedule <- read_excel("files/schedule_modules.xlsx",
                       sheet = "Schedule_date")

schedule_1 <- schedule[1:2,]
schedule_2 <- schedule[3:5,]
schedule_3 <- schedule[6:8,]
schedule_4 <- schedule[9:nrow(schedule),]
```

```{r}
kable(schedule_1)
```

## 🗓️ Schedule (part 2)

```{r schedule2, echo = FALSE}
kable(schedule_2)
```

## 🗓️ Schedule (part 3)

```{r schedule3, echo = FALSE}
kable(schedule_3)
```

## 🗓️ Schedule (part 4) {.smaller}

```{r schedule4, echo = FALSE}
kable(schedule_4)
```

# Why do we visualize our data? 🗣️ {.center_title}

## There may be a data dinosaur 🦖 {background-color="#fff"}

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.alt="A gif of 13 different datasets (include one who's points make the shape of a dinosaur) that all have the same mean and standard deviation, but have very different distributions"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/dinosaurus.gif")
```

Figure by [Alberto Cairo](https://www.autodesk.com/research/publications/same-stats-different-graphs)

## To discover data secrets {.center_title background-color="#fff"}

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.alt="A 3 panel figure showing raw data, boxplots, and violin plots demonstrating how boxplots don't fully explain the distribution of data"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/boxplots.gif")
```

Figures from [Justin Matejka and George Fitzmaurice](https://www.autodesk.com/research/publications/same-stats-different-graphs)

## To convey our message

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.alt="Figure from Bilbrey et al., 2021 New Phytologist showing the locations on the apple genetic map (17 chromosomes) where there are significant associations between metabolomic features, and genomic markers.", fig.cap="Bilbrey et al., New Phytologist, 2021"}
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("img/apple_chr_map.png")
```

## The data visualization process {.center_title}

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.alt="A figure with three circles, and arrows between the first and second, and second and third. First circle says data, middle circle says analyst, and third right-most circle says learner. In between data and analyst= is explore, analyze and learn, and in between analyst and learner is explain, explore and persuade."}

# Small changes can make a big difference (and some examples)

## Simple changes improve interpretability {.center_title background-color="#fff"}

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggpubr)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
#| column: page
#| layout-nrow: 1
#| fig-height: 5.5
#| fig-width: 5

gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Asia" & year == "2007") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = lifeExp, y = country)) +
    geom_col() + theme_bw() + 
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size =12))

```

gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Asia" & year == "2007") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = lifeExp, y = country)) +
    geom_col() + theme_bw() + 
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size =12))

gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Asia" & year == "2007") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = lifeExp, y = reorder(country, lifeExp))) +
    geom_col() + theme_bw() +
   theme(axis.text = element_text(size =12))
```

## Encoding data with easy-to-process visual clues

Length is easier to see than angles or areas.

```{r echo = FALSE}
data <- data.frame(
  group=LETTERS[1:5],
  value=c(14,15,17,19,20)
)
```

```{r}
#| column: page
#| layout-nrow: 1
#| fig-height: 4.5
#| fig-width: 5

data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x="", y=value, fill=group)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", width=1, color = "black") +
  coord_polar("y", start=0) +
  theme_void()


```

data %>%

  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## Color scales should be intuitive and accessible

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.alt="Figure with two maps of Georgia, depciting COVID cases per 100K people from July 2, 2020 and July 17, 2020. The color scale goes from white, to light blue, to dark blue, then to red, and the number of people in the different bins are not the same across plots. "}

```

These are not.

## Avoid figure spaghetti 🍝

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(hrbrthemes)
library(kableExtra)
options(knitr.table.format = "html")
library(babynames)
library(viridis)
library(DT)
library(plotly)

# Load dataset from github
data <- babynames %>% 
  filter(name %in% c("Mary","Emma", "Ida", "Ashley", "Amanda", "Jessica",    
                     "Patricia", "Linda", "Deborah",   "Dorothy", "Betty", "Helen")) %>%
  filter(sex=="F")

# Plot
data %>%
  ggplot( aes(x=year, y=n, group=name, color=name)) +
    geom_line() +

    ) +
    labs(title = "A spaghetti chart of baby names popularity",
         caption = "From https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/spaghetti.html",
         y = "Number of babies") +
    facet_wrap(~name) 
```

## Be consistent among figures

- Use the same color schemes/shapes across figures

- If you're ordering/grouping, do so in the same manner


## Make sure your plot has a clear message 🍕

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.alt="Figure showing the average height of women (y-axis) from different countries (x-axis). But the y-axis only goes from 5 foot to 5 foot 7 inches, making women from India look tiny and women from Latvia seem enormous."}
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("img/bad_pizza.png")
```

## Marie Kondo your plots

Declutter, and keep only parts that are informative (and spark joy) 😻

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.alt="A very ugly 3D plot showing life expectancy across the 5 continents where the 3D makes it hard to read, it has duplicative legends, and meaningless colors.", fig.cap="From https://socviz.co/lookatdata.html"}
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("img/bad_life_expectancy.png")
```

## Oral presentation and publication figures might not be the same

# Some take home messages

## What should you think about when making visualizations?

1.  Who are you talking to? 📢

2.  What are you trying to convey? 📝

3.  How can you fairly represent your data? 🚯
