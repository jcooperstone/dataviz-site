I will pick these times based on your availability such that everyone can attend at least one. \nCourse description\nThis course aims to introduce students to the principles and practice of data visualization. Students will learn fundamental principles of data visualization and create figures that appropriately and ethically represent their data. Data visualizations will be created in the R programming environment, using tools including the grammar of graphics implemented in ggplot2. In the process of creating visualizations, students will also become familiar with data handling and wrangling in R.\nCourse learning outcomes  By the end of this course, students should successfully be able to:\nRecall and describe the fundamental goals and principles of data visualization.\nDistinguish between good and bad visualizations, and understand how to make those are ineffective more effective.\nLearn to use R, R Markdown, and ggplot to make clear, descriptive, and aesthetic visualization.\nApply principles learned in class, both theoretical and technical, to create effective visualizations.\nCourse delivery\nMode of delivery: This course is a hybrid-delivered course taught using ‚Äúflipped classroom‚Äù instruction. I will post weekly videos which you will watch (and code along with) on your own, and during class (which you can attend in person or virtually) we will have recitation style activities. You are also welcome to come to class with questions about the weekly videos, or problems you are currently encountering in creating your visualizations.\nAttendance and participation requirements: This is a hybrid course, but is taught synchronously, meaning it is expected that you attend class, either in person or virtually during its meeting time.\nClass recordings: To help you master material, and to better accommodate students, classes will be recorded, and recordings uploaded directly after class to Carmen.\nCourse schedule\n\n\n\n\nWeek\nModule\nTopic\n1\n1: Principles\nPrinciples of data visualization\n2\n1: Principles\nGood and bad visualizations\n3\n2: Coding fundamental\nR Markdown for reproducible research\n4\n2: Coding fundamental\nGrammar of graphics\n5\n2: Coding fundamental\nThemes, labels, facets\n6\n3: Data exploration\nData distributions\n7\n3: Data exploration\nCorrelations\n8\n3: Data exploration\nAnnotating statistics\n9\n4: Putting it together\nPrincipal components analysis\n10\n4: Putting it together\nManhattan plots\n11\n4: Putting it together\nInteractive plots\n12\n4: Putting it together\nMaking lots of plots at once\n13\n4: Putting it together\nCapstone assignment open session\n14\n4: Putting it together\nCapstone assignment open session\n\nCourse resources\nThere are no required textbooks for this course, though you will find many of the recommend texts and resources belowvery useful.\nR for Data Science by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund\nIntroduction to Data Science by Rafael Irizarry\nData Visualization with R by Rob Kabacoff\nData Visualization, A practical introduction by Kieran Healy\nHands-On Data Visualization by Jack Dougherty and Ilya Ilyankou\nFundamentals of Data Visualization by Claus O.

You can do so many things in R (including building this course website).\nRStudio Desktop: This IDE (integrated development environment) allows a user-friendly interface with the R programming environment, which we will use in class as well. You must have R before you download RStudio (free).\nMicrosoft Office 365: All Ohio State students are now eligible for free Microsoft Office 365. Full instructions for downloading and installation can be found at go.osu.edu/office365help.\nPrior R experience\nYou do not need to be an R expert for this class, but I will assume working-level knowledge of R programming. If you have no experience with R, but would still like to take this class, you can. I ask then you get yourself up to speed by taking this free online class https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-r-basics (audit only) before the start of the 3rd week of class. Tips and tricks in R will be scattered throughout the course material.\nGrading\nHow your grade is calculated\nModule assignments: 40 points (10 points per assignment, 4 assignments)\nClass reflections: 20 points (2 points per reflection, 10 reflections)\nCapstone assignment: 40 points\nSee the Assignments tab for additional information.\nAssignment descriptions\nModule assignments: After each module, there will be an assignment to provide practice for the techniques learned in class. Assignments will be posted at least one week prior to their due date, and due dates can be found on Carmen.\nClass reflections: After each week, you will write a 1 paragraph reflection on the material that was presented in class. This can include your thoughts on how you will use these lessons in your own research and data visualizations, ways in which you have investigated this topic (or expect to) on your own, or what else you‚Äôd like to learn in this area. The purpose of this assignment is not to be burdensome, but to keep you engaged in the course material, and providing feedback to me on what parts you‚Äôve found useful, what you‚Äôve struggled with, and what you‚Äôd like to see more of in the future.\nCapstone assignment: At the end of the semester, you will complete a capstone assignment where you create a series of visualizations based on your research data, data coming from your lab, or other data that is publicly available.

I also expect your code to be fully commented such that I can understand what you are doing with each step, and why.\nLate assignments\nI expect you will turn assignments in on time. However, I am also reasonable want to see you master the material in this class. If there are extenuating circumstances that prevent you from turning in an assignment on time, please connect with me as soon as possible after such a situation arises for further discussion. Unexcused late assignments will be docked 10% of total possible points per day late.\nPlease refer to Carmen for assignment due dates.\nGrading scale\n93‚Äì100: A, 90‚Äì92.9: A-, 87‚Äì89.9: B+, 83‚Äì86.9: B, 80‚Äì82.9: B-, 77‚Äì79.9: C+, 73‚Äì76.9: C, 70‚Äì72.9: C-, 67‚Äì69.9: D+, 60‚Äì66.9: D, Below 60: E,\nInstructor feedback and response time\nGrading and feedback: For assignments, you can generally expect feedback within 7 days.\nEmail: I will reply to emails within 48 hours on days when class is in session at the university.\nOther course policies\nDiscussion and communication guidelines\nI expect all communication will be respectful and thoughtful.\nAcademic Misconduct/Academic Integrity\nAcademic integrity is essential to maintaining an environment that fosters excellence in teaching, research, and other educational and scholarly activities. Thus, The Ohio State University and the Committee on Academic Misconduct (COAM) expect that all students have read and understand the University‚Äôs Code of Student Conduct, and that all students will complete all academic and scholarly assignments with fairness and honesty. Students must recognize that failure to follow the rules and guidelines established in the University‚Äôs Code of Student Conduct and this syllabus may constitute Academic Misconduct.\nThe Ohio State University‚Äôs Code of Student Conduct (Section 3335-23-04) defines academic misconduct as: Any activity that tends to compromise the academic integrity of the University, or subvert the educational process. Examples of academic misconduct include (but are not limited to) plagiarism, collusion (unauthorized collaboration), copying the work of another student, and possession of unauthorized materials during an examination. Ignorance of the University‚Äôs Code of Student Conduct is never considered an excuse for academic misconduct, so I recommend that you review the Code of Student Conduct and, specifically, the sections dealing with academic misconduct.\nIf I suspect that a student has committed academic misconduct in this course, I am obligated by University Rules to report my suspicions to the Committee on Academic Misconduct. If COAM determines that you have violated the University‚Äôs Code of Student Conduct (i.e., committed academic misconduct), the sanctions for the misconduct could include a failing grade in this course and suspension or dismissal from the University.\nIf you have any questions about the above policy or what constitutes academic misconduct in this course, please contact me.\nCreating an environment free from harassment, discrimination, and sexual misconduct\nThe Ohio State University is committed to building and maintaining a community to reflect diversity and to improve opportunities for all.
