We will pick these\ntimes based on your availability such that everyone can attend at least\none. \nCourse description\nThis course aims to introduce students to the principles and practice\nof data visualization. Students will learn fundamental principles of\ndata visualization and create figures that appropriately and ethically\nrepresent their data. Data visualizations will be created in the R\nprogramming environment, using tools including the grammar of graphics\nimplemented in ggplot2. In the process of creating visualizations,\nstudents will also become familiar with data handling and wrangling in\nR.\nCourse learning outcomes  By the end of this\ncourse, students should successfully be able to:\nRecall and describe the fundamental goals and principles of data\nvisualization.\nDistinguish between good and bad visualizations, and understand how\nto make those are ineffective more effective.\nLearn to use R, R Markdown, and ggplot to make clear, descriptive,\nand aesthetic visualization.\nApply principles learned in class, both theoretical and technical,\nto create effective visualizations.\nCourse delivery\nMode of delivery: This course is a hybrid-delivered\ncourse taught using ‚Äúflipped classroom‚Äù instruction. I will post weekly\nvideos which you will watch (and code along with) on your own, and\nduring class (which you can attend in person or virtually) we will have\nrecitation style activities. You are also welcome to come to class with\nquestions about the weekly videos, or problems you are currently\nencountering in creating your visualizations.\nAttendance and participation requirements: This is a\nhybrid course, but is taught synchronously, meaning it is expected that\nyou attend class, either in person or virtually during its meeting\ntime.\nClass recordings: To help you master material, and\nto better accommodate students, classes will be recorded, and recordings\nuploaded directly after class to Carmen.\nCourse schedule\n\n\n\n\nWeek\nModule\nTopic\n1\n1: Principles\nPrinciples of data visualization\n2\n1: Principles\nGood and bad visualizations\n3\n2: Coding fundamentals\nR Markdown for reproducible research\n4\n2: Coding fundamentals\nggplot 101\n5\n2: Coding fundamentals\nThemes, labels, facets (ggplot 102)\n6\n3: Data exploration\nData distributions\n7\n3: Data exploration\nCorrelations\n8\n3: Data exploration\nAnnotating statistics\n9\n4: Putting it together\nPrincipal components analysis\n10\n4: Putting it together\nManhattan plots\n11\n4: Putting it together\nInteractive plots\n12\n4: Putting it together\nMaking lots of plots at once\n13\n4: Putting it together\nCapstone assignment open session\n14\n4: Putting it together\nCapstone assignment open session\n\nCourse resources\nThere are no required textbooks for this course, though you will find\nmany of the recommend texts and resources belowvery useful.\nR for Data Science\nby Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund\nIntroduction to Data\nScience by Rafael Irizarry\nData Visualization\nwith R by Rob Kabacoff\nData Visualization, A practical\nintroduction by Kieran Healy\nHands-On Data\nVisualization by Jack Dougherty and Ilya Ilyankou\nFundamentals of Data\nVisualization by Claus O.

Thus, The Ohio State University and the Committee\non Academic Misconduct (COAM) expect that all students have read and\nunderstand the University‚Äôs Code of Student Conduct, and that all\nstudents will complete all academic and scholarly assignments with\nfairness and honesty. Students must recognize that failure to follow the\nrules and guidelines established in the University‚Äôs Code of Student\nConduct and this syllabus may constitute Academic Misconduct.\nThe Ohio State University‚Äôs Code of Student Conduct (Section\n3335-23-04) defines academic misconduct as: Any activity that tends to\ncompromise the academic integrity of the University, or subvert the\neducational process. Examples of academic misconduct include (but are\nnot limited to) plagiarism, collusion (unauthorized collaboration),\ncopying the work of another student, and possession of unauthorized\nmaterials during an examination. Ignorance of the University‚Äôs Code of\nStudent Conduct is never considered an excuse for academic misconduct,\nso I recommend that you review the Code of Student Conduct and,\nspecifically, the sections dealing with academic misconduct.\nIf I suspect that a student has committed academic misconduct in this\ncourse, I am obligated by University Rules to report my suspicions to\nthe Committee on Academic Misconduct. If COAM determines that you have\nviolated the University‚Äôs Code of Student Conduct (i.e., committed\nacademic misconduct), the sanctions for the misconduct could include a\nfailing grade in this course and suspension or dismissal from the\nUniversity.\nIf you have any questions about the above policy or what\nconstitutes academic misconduct in this course, please contact\nme.\nCreating\nan environment free from harassment, discrimination, and sexual\nmisconduct\nThe Ohio State University is committed to building and maintaining a\ncommunity to reflect diversity and to improve opportunities for all. All\nBuckeyes have the right to be free from harassment, discrimination, and\nsexual misconduct. Ohio State does not discriminate on the basis of age,\nancestry, color, disability, ethnicity, gender, gender identity or\nexpression, genetic information, HIV/AIDS status, military status,\nnational origin, pregnancy (childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of\npregnancy, or recovery therefrom), race, religion, sex, sexual\norientation, or protected veteran status, or any other bases under the\nlaw, in its activities, academic programs, admission, and employment.\nMembers of the university community also have the right to be free from\nall forms of sexual misconduct: sexual harassment, sexual assault,\nrelationship violence, stalking, and sexual exploitation.\nTo report harassment, discrimination, sexual misconduct, or\nretaliation and/or seek confidential and non-confidential resources and\nsupportive measures, contact the Office of Institutional Equity by: 1.\nOnline reporting form at equity.osu.edu, 2.
