## Introduction

Today's recitation materials are on a bunch of stuff I thought was interesting but didn't fit specifically into any of the other lessons. This includes some cool ggplot extension packages we haven't gone over yet, and heatmaps that utilize base R plotting.

### Load libraries
Loading the libraries that are for each section. Individual libraries are before each section so you can see which go with what plot types.
```{r load libraries}
library(tidyverse) # for everything
library(gghighlight) # for highlighting
library(patchwork) # compiling plots
library(gganimate) # animating plots
library(ggrepel) # for text/label repelling
library(magick) # for gif rendering
library(ggradar) # radar plots
library(scales) # for scaling data
library(pheatmap) # clustered heatmaps

library(readxl) # for rading in data
```

## Data
```{r}
emissions <- read_excel("data/co2_emissions_tonnes_per_person.xlsx")
```


## Really start using an Rproject üìΩÔ∏è

```{r rproj illustration, fig.alt = "A cartoon of a cracked glass cube looking frustrated with casts on its arm and leg, with bandaids on it, containing ‚Äúsetwd‚Äù, looks on at a metal riveted cube labeled ‚ÄúR Proj‚Äù holding a skateboard looking sympathetic, and a smaller cube with a helmet on labeled ‚Äúhere‚Äù doing a trick on a skateboard.", fig.cap= "Artwork by [@allison_horst](https://twitter.com/allison_horst)", out.width = "70%", fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rproj.png")
```

If you don't have a Rproject for class, set one up.

## Visualization 1
https://www.gapminder.org/data/ CO2 emissions
```{r}
recent_emissions <- emissions %>%
  select(country, `2000`:`2017`)

recent_emissions_tidy <- recent_emissions %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = `2000`:`2017`,
               names_to = "year",
               values_to = "emissions")

recent_emissions_tidy %>%
  filter(year == 2000) %>%
  arrange(desc(emissions)) 

recent_emissions_tidy %>%
  filter(year == 2017) %>%
  arrange(desc(emissions)) 

recent_emissions_tidy %>%
  filter(year == 2000) %>%
  arrange(emissions)

recent_emissions_tidy %>%
  filter(year == 2017) %>%
  arrange(emissions)

recent_emissions_tidy %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = emissions, group = country, color = country)) +
  geom_line() +
  gghighlight()
```


Make a publication quality plot that shows the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy. Label the points with the name of the country for those that have the highest and lowest 

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = lifeExp, y = gdpPercap, color = continent, label = country)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_label_repel(show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
#  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format(), trans = "log2") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Life Expectancy (years)",
       y = "GDP Per Capita (US Dollars)",
       color = "Continent")
  
```





### Wrangle
We can create a dataframe that includes only the data for the countries in the continent Americas.
```{r gghlighlight wrangling}
gapminder_americas <- gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Americas")
```

### Plot
If we look at all the countries at once, we get plot spaghetti üçù.
```{r gghighlight base plot, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
gapminder_americas %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, group = country, color = country)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Life Expectancy (years)",
       title = "Life Expectancy in Countries in the Americas",
       subtitle = "From 1952 to 2007",
       caption = "Data from gapminder.org")
```

Create a lineplot showing the life expectacy over 1952 to 2007 for all countries, highlighting the United States.
```{r gghighlight US, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# highlight just the US
gapminder_americas %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, group = country, color = country)) +
  geom_line() +
  gghighlight(country == "United States") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Life Expectancy (years)",
       title = "Life Expectancy in Countries in the Americas",
       subtitle = "From 1952 to 2007",
       caption = "Data from gapminder.org")
```

Facet our plot, and highlight the country for each facet.
```{r gghighlight facet, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# facet and highlight each country
gapminder_americas %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = country)) +
  gghighlight() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 8),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  facet_wrap(~country) +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Life Expectancy (years)",
       title = "Life Expectancy in Countries in the Americas",
       subtitle = "From 1952 to 2007",
       caption = "Data from gapminder.org")
```

## patchwork, a little more üìàüìäüìâ

```{r patchwork illustration, fig.alt = "Fuzzy cartoon monsters in white gloves and uniforms hanging multiple plots together on a wall, with an artist monster wearing a beret and smock directing them to the correct orientation. There is a blueprint plan on the wall showing how the plots should be arranged. Stylized title font reads ‚Äúpatchwork - combine & arrange your ggplots!‚Äù", fig.cap= "Artwork by [@allison_horst](https://twitter.com/allison_horst)", out.width = "70%", fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/patchwork.png")
```

We have talked a bit about [`patchwork`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/) in the [lecture on PCA](https://datavisualizing.netlify.app/4_09_pca/09_pca#patchwork) but its such a useful package I wanted to go over it a bit more. The goal of `patchwork` is to make it very simple to combine plots together.

### Load libraries
```{r patchwork library}
library(patchwork)
library(palmerpenguins) # for making some plots to assemble
```

### Make some plots

```{r patchwork make plots}
plot1 <- penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_boxplot()

plot2 <- penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point()

plot3 <- penguins %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = island, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(vars(sex))
```

### Combine plots

```{r patchwork regular combine}
(plot1 + plot2) / plot3 
```

```{r patchwork add panel labels and title}
(plot1 + plot2) / plot3 + plot_annotation(tag_levels = "A",
                                          title = "Here is some information about penguins")
```

## gganimate üíÉ

```{r gganimate illustration, fig.alt = "Cartoon of a bunch of monsters watching data points of varing color and shape fly across a screen like fireworks. Several monsters are lighting the data off like fireworks. Stylized text reads ‚Äúgganimate: action figures!‚Äù", fig.cap= "Artwork by [@allison_horst](https://twitter.com/allison_horst)", out.width = "70%", fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/gganimate.png")
```

https://gganimate.com/reference/transition_states.html

### Install
```{r gganimate install, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("gganimate") # gganimate
install.packages("gapminder") # gapminder data for example
install.packages("magick") # for gif rendering
```

### Load libraries
```{r gganimate libraries}
library(gganimate)
library(ggrepel) # for text/label repelling
library(magick) # for gif rendering
```

### Plot
```{r gganimate make plot and set params}
plot_to_animate <- gapminder_americas %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = lifeExp, y = pop, fill = country, label = country)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, color = "black") +
  geom_text_repel() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = 'none') +
  labs(title = "Population and Life Expectancy in the Americas",
       subtitle = 'Year: {closest_state}', 
       x = "Life Expectancy", 
       y = "Log10 Population") +
  transition_states(year) # what to gif over

# set parameters for your animation
animated_plot <- animate(plot = plot_to_animate, 
                        duration = 10, 
                        fps = 10, 
                        width = 700, 
                        height = 700,
                        renderer = magick_renderer())
```

### Print
Print your animation.
```{r gganimate show animation, eval = FALSE}
animated_plot
```

```{r gganimate actually show animation, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("gapminder_gif.gif")
```


### Save
Save your animation.
```{r gganimate save animation, eval = FALSE}
# save it
anim_save(filename = "gapminder_gif.gif",
          animation = last_animation())
```

## ggradar üì°
The package [`ggradar`](https://github.com/ricardo-bion/ggradar) allows you to create radar plots, which allow the plotting of multidimensional data on a two dimension chart. Typically with these plots, the goal is to compare the variables on the plot across different groups. We are going to try this out with the coffee tasting data from the [distributions recitation](3_06_distributions/06_distributions_recitation_solutions.html)

Install `ggradar` if you don't already have it. This package is not available on CRAN for the newest version of R, so we can use `devtools` and `install_github()` to install it. You could also try using `install.packages()` and see if that works for you.
```{r ggradar install, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ricardo-bion/ggradar",
                         dependencies = TRUE)
```

```{r ggradar libraries data, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(ggradar)
library(scales) # for scaling data

# load coffee data from distributions recitation
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2020-07-07')

# extract out df on coffee_ratings
coffee <- tuesdata$coffee_ratings

# what are the column names again?
colnames(coffee)
```

```{r ggradar wrangling}
coffee_radar <- coffee %>%
  select(species, aroma:cupper_points) %>% # first column is the groups
  mutate_at(vars(-species), rescale) %>% # columns need to be between 0 and 1
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize_if(is.numeric, mean) 

coffee_labels <- c("Aroma",
                   "Flavor",
                   "Aftertaste",
                   "Acidity",
                   "Body",
                   "Balance",
                   "Uniformity",
                   "Clean cup",
                   "Sweetness",
                   "Cupper points")
```

```{r ggradar coffee radar plot}
ggradar(coffee_radar)
```

```{r ggradar coffee radar plotclean}
ggradar(coffee_radar,
        axis.labels = coffee_labels,
        legend.position = "bottom",
        axis.label.size = 3,
        grid.label.size = 5) +
  theme(legend.key = element_rect(fill = NA, color = NA),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 16),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 12)) +
  labs(title = "Difference in average coffee cupper score \nin Arabica and Robusta beans")
```

## Heatmaps üü•‚¨úÔ∏èüü¶

### Install
```{r pheatmap install, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("pheatmap")
```

### Load libraries
```{r pheatmap library}
library(pheatmap)
```

### Plot
```{r pheatmap plot}
pheatmap(mtcars)
```

```{r pheatmap plot scaled clustered}
pheatmap(mtcars, 
         scale = "column",
         cluster_rows = TRUE) # cluster rows based on similarity
```


### ConplexHeatmap

The package [`ComplexHeatmap`](https://jokergoo.github.io/ComplexHeatmap-reference/book/index.html) allows more customized and complicated heatmaps to be produced. If you are interested in making heatmaps, this package is worth to check out.

## In class

In class, we will practice making use of these leftovers.
